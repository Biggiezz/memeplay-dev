# 🎮 MemePlay Docs (2026)

MemePlay is a TikTok-style feed for short games.

Instead of scrolling videos, users scroll and play games.
Fast games. Short sessions. Endless discovery.

Web3 is an optional ownership layer —
not a requirement, not speculation.

## What Is MemePlay?

MemePlay is a game discovery and creation platform
where anyone can create, play, and share short games
designed for 10–30 second sessions.

Think TikTok —
but instead of watching videos, you play games.

MemePlay focuses on:

- Active attention, not passive scrolling
- Replay behavior, not one-time impressions
- Distribution, not single hit games

## The Core Idea

Most games fail because they depend on one thing:
being good enough to survive alone.

MemePlay is different.

We don't bet on one game.
We build a feed where:

- Good games rise
- Weak games disappear
- The platform benefits from attention flow

The feed is the product.
Games are the content.

## The MemePlay Loop (Core Mechanism)

1. User scrolls the game feed
2. Plays a short game (10–20 seconds)
3. Replays or skips
4. Discovers the next game

The platform optimizes for:

- Plays per session
- Replay rate
- Sustained attention, not spikes

If a game is fun → it gets replayed
If not → it disappears naturally

No manual curation.
No hype-driven ranking.

## Who Is MemePlay For?

### 🎮 For Players

- Instant play — no wallet, no login
- No installs, no downloads
- Short games designed for quick fun
- Endless discovery through the feed
- Free by default

Players come for entertainment, not finance.

### 🧠 For Creators

Creators use MemePlay to:

- Create games quickly using templates
- Distribute games through a built-in feed
- Test ideas fast with real players
- Build attention and reputation
- Unlock ownership only after attention is proven

You don't need:

- Coding skills
- A token
- Smart contracts
- DeFi knowledge

Create first.
Earn attention first.
Ownership comes later.

## Create a Game (MVP1 – No-Code)

MVP1 is designed for speed and simplicity.

### Step 1 — Choose a Template

Available templates:

- Flappy-style flying game
- Pacman-style maze collector
- Endless jumper
- Tap-and-dodge arcade

All templates are:

- Mobile-first
- Portrait optimized
- Designed for short sessions

### Step 2 — Customize Your Game

You can easily customize:

- Game character
- Colors & background
- Logo or mascot (optional)
- End-of-game message
- Social links (X, Telegram, website)

This turns a game into a shareable experience.

### Step 3 — Adjust Gameplay

Using sliders (no code):

- Speed
- Difficulty
- Map selection
- Spawn frequency
- Enemy behavior (template-based)
- Sound on/off

### Step 4 — Publish & Share

1. Click Publish
2. Get a unique game URL
3. Share anywhere (X, Telegram, Discord, website)
4. Players start instantly

No wallet.
No install.
No friction.

## Why This Works

Traditional marketing interrupts users.
Games invite participation.

Instead of forcing attention:

- Users choose to play
- Replays create natural exposure
- Attention compounds organically

For players → entertainment
For creators → distribution
For the platform → sustained engagement

## Attention First, Ownership Later

MemePlay is not GameFi.

We do NOT launch tokens by default.
We do NOT encourage speculation.

Ownership is unlocked only after attention exists.

## Token & On-Chain Design (Later Phase)

Tokens are optional and permissioned.

A game may unlock token support only if it:

- Shows sustained attention
- Is replayed naturally
- Performs well inside the feed

Example unlock signals:

- ≥ 1,000 plays over multiple days
- ≥ 2 plays per session
- Strong retention without cash rewards

Token rules:

- Limited number of games per week
- Permissioned unlock
- Designed to reward attention, not hype

If a game loses attention, the token loses relevance.
This aligns incentives naturally.

## Using MemePlay as a Brand or Community

Brands and communities are one type of creator.

They can use MemePlay to:

- Create interactive content
- Engage communities through play
- Share stories inside games
- Appear naturally at game-over moments

Brand elements never interrupt gameplay.
They appear as part of the experience.

MemePlay is not an ad network.
It's a playable distribution layer.

## Monetization Philosophy

MemePlay monetizes attention, not speculation.

Possible revenue streams:

- Featured placement in the feed
- Creator tools and services
- Optional sponsorships
- Non-intrusive in-game ads (later)
- Platform utilities (future)

No pay-to-win.
No forced deposits.
No gambling mechanics.
